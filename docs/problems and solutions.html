I couldn't make sequelize work with 4 models.
I cut the studentteacher and studentbehavior models and let sequelize create them by itself.

I decided to do this because Sequelize did not recognize the association. I was using
StudentTeacher.findAll({where:{teacher_id:1},include{model:Teacher}})
but Sequelize did not find a relationship between teacher and student.

Next I deleted the studentteacher and studentbehavior models and let Sequelize create the
tables and the relationships by itself. Success on that.

Used findAll and succeeded, but when included where clause sequelize did not recognize. It was related
to the problem at the beginning. I solved it by using a Teacher model to initiate the search,
instead of Student. I was wrong searching Student and limiting by a where clause using a teacher_id
because Student does not have a teacher_id on it.

I switched Student for Teacher and the search worked. It retrieves the teachers with a
nest of students.

It looks like it is not possible to search using a bridge table as the search table.
